DevPlane is an  upcoming developer platform that will aim to keep software developers informed, relevant, and up-to-date in a fast-changing tech landscape. It will delivers curated and customizable tech news, highlights trending tools and frameworks, and offers AI-enhanced features, learning resources, and community interactions.

With the software development industry changing and evolving everyday at a rapid pace, DevPlane aims to empower developers by helping them stay updated with industry news, explore new technologies, and connect with the developer community.

**Tools being used for this project:**

- `Next.js` â€“ Will serve as the core frontend framework, enabling fast page loads through server-side rendering and static site generation. It provides a robust routing system and SEO-friendly architecture, ensuring a seamless and performant user experience across the platform.
- `React.js` â€“ Powers the interactive user interface with reusable, modular components. Used within the Next.js framework, it enables dynamic features like user dashboards, personalized feeds, and real-time updates, enhancing the responsiveness of the platform.
- `TypeScript` â€“  Going to add strong static typing to the JavaScript codebase, improving code reliability, maintainability, and developer productivity. It reduces runtime errors and enables better tooling support during development.
- `Node.js` â€“  Supporting backend logic and server-side APIs that handle user authentication, data processing, and interactions with Firebase services. It ensures scalability and performance for server operations.
- `TensorFlow` -Integrating machine learning capabilities into the application, enabling personalized content recommendations, trend predictions, and AI-driven developer insights that keep users informed and engaged.
- `Firebase` â€“ Providing backend infrastructure including authentication, hosting, and cloud functions. It simplifies user management (sign-up/sign-in) and ensures secure access to platform features.
- `Firestore` â€“ Acting as the cloud-hosted NoSQL database for storing and syncing user data, news updates, and developer interactions in real-time. It supports scalability and low-latency access to data across users and devices.
