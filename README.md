DevPlane is an  upcoming developer platform that will aim to keep software developers informed, relevant, and up-to-date in a fast-changing tech landscape. It will delivers curated and customizable tech news, highlights trending tools and frameworks, and offers AI-enhanced features, learning resources, and community interactions.

With the software development industry changing and evolving everyday at a rapid pace, DevPlane aims to empower developers by helping them stay updated with industry news, explore new technologies, and connect with the developer community.

**Tools being used for this project:**

- `Next.js` – serves as the core application framework, providing server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for fast page loads and SEO-friendly pages. It also functions as an orchestration layer through API routes and server actions, securely connecting the frontend with backend services and AI systems.
- `React.js` – powers the interactive user interface using reusable, modular components within the Next.js framework. It enables dynamic features such as user dashboards, personalized feeds, and real-time UI updates, ensuring a responsive and engaging user experience.
- `TypeScript` –  adds strong static typing across the JavaScript and React codebase, improving reliability, maintainability, and developer productivity. It reduces runtime errors and provides better tooling and autocomplete support when integrating APIs, Firebase services, and AI-driven features.
- `Node.js` –  supports server-side logic through Next.js API routes and server actions. It handles authentication workflows, request validation, data processing, and communication with Firebase and AI services, ensuring scalable and efficient backend operations.
- Python - used as a dedicated AI and machine learning layer, responsible for training and serving advanced models. Leveraging TensorFlow’s Python ecosystem, this layer enables features such as personalized recommendations, trend prediction, semantic analysis, and AI-driven insights. The Python service communicates with the Next.js backend via secure APIs, keeping AI workloads isolated and scalable.
- `TensorFlow` -Integrating machine learning capabilities into the application, enabling personalized content recommendations, trend predictions, and AI-driven developer insights that keep users informed and engaged.
- `Firebase` – Providing backend infrastructure including authentication, hosting, and cloud functions. It simplifies user management (sign-up/sign-in) and ensures secure access to platform features.
- `Firestore` – Acting as the cloud-hosted NoSQL database for storing and syncing user data, news updates, and developer interactions in real-time. It supports scalability and low-latency access to data across users and devices.
